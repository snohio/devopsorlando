> Come prepared with some ideas or just listen in. Lean Coffee is a quick Kanban style of organizing technical discussions for 10-15 people across many topics. We'll start discussing at voting on the topics by 7:15 and go until we run out (or we're past closing time.)
> 
> All are welcome, whether you're currently working full-time in DevOps or are just passively curious.
> 
> No need to eat ahead of time as they have food there: https://www.oviedobrewingco.com/current-beers/ (hyperlink says beers, but it shows food as well).
