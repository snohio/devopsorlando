  - **Brief description of event including style or genre**  
  DevOps is a methodology in the software development and IT industry that focuses on automation to combine software and IT operations. When we have a lot of people at an event, it starts to make sense to add some structure to the conversation but keep the spontaneity and [Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/) is one of many approaches to do that.
