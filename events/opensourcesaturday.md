# Open Source Saturday

## Agenda

* Welcome / Introduction / usual logistics, code of conduct, sponsors
* A presentation on the basics of Open Source. 15-30 min (I'd be good with getting into the philosophical reasons for open source. A quick OSS Licensing Review might be good to)
* Technical Walk Through (demo) of How to contribute. What documents to read. How to find something to contribute.
* Q&A
* >Try to put together a list of repositories that folks can review and determine what they want to contribute to. (If we can get this out before hand that would be good)
* Workshop / Hackathon where people contribute from 11 - 3.
* Presentation(s) at the end by folks who did contributions if they want.
* Follow up to see that those contributions were successfully pulled (can take months...)
