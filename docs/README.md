# Orlando DevOps Community Group

## Welcome My Orlando DevOps People

Welcome to the quick and dirty Github Pages for Orlando DevOps Community group. Here you will find some very basic links to some slide decks and other information about our group. Eventually, we will have a better thing than this, but hey, it's [Everything as Code](https://snohio.github.io/eac)
