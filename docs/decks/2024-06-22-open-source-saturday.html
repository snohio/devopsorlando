## [Code of Conduct](https://orlandodevs.com/code-of-conduct/)

> This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Orlando Devs community (relevant to both our Slack and Meetup), as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

### Our open source community strives to:

#### Be friendly and patient.
#### Be welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
#### Be considerate: Your actions (and words) affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember that we’re a very diverse community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.
#### Be respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
#### Be careful in the words that we choose: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.
#### Try to understand why we disagree: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

NOTES:

It is that time of our night where we will invite all of our guests on stage for you to ask your questions. Let's look at the Q&A.

While we compile a few of those, let me start off with one that I wanted to ask everyone.

* Where do you think DevOps / Cloud & Platform Engineering / SRE is heading
* How do you see AI changing the jobs roles?
* Are you seeing applicants using AI for their resume?
* Tell me one thing everyone should do this weekend to make themselves a little more valuable on the market.
