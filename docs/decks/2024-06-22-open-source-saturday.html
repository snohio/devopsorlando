## [Code of Conduct](https://orlandodevs.com/code-of-conduct/)

> This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Orlando Devs community (relevant to both our Slack and Meetup), as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

### Our open source community strives to:

#### Be friendly and patient.
#### Be welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.
#### Be considerate: Your actions (and words) affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember that we’re a very diverse community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.
#### Be respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
#### Be careful in the words that we choose: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.
#### Try to understand why we disagree: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

## Mike Butler - Progress Chef
<img src="../assets/mike-butler-speaker.jpg" align="left" width="300" hspace="50">
<br>
### DevOps Enthusiast, Space Nerd, and Senior Sales Engineer
<br><br><br>
#### DevOps Enthusiast since 2016, space nerd and currently Sr. Sales Engineer at Progress for Chef Software. Mike has seen all sides of the Coded Enterprise, being the product owner for Chef at a very large healthcare organization. It is always a challenge to help application and OS support teams to understand “shifting left” or better local development, local testing, using a source code repository for code and helping to identify and track work. Treating Everything as Code helps drive DevOps for n00bs, it certainly helped him!
???
NOTES: (5 minutes)

* Thanks Dan! So before we jump in and to give folks a bit of a taste for what's to come this evening, I have a couple of questions for you.
* Tell me a little bit about the Computer Science program here at Rollins.
* What are some of the changes Rollins has made to modernize it's programs with the introduction of DevOps and Cloud & Platform Engineering?
* What do you see coming with the latest advances in AI? How is that changing the programs here at Rollins?

MY BIO (5 minutes)

* So, Hi there! My name is Mike Butler. I am a Solution Architect at Progress Chef. Ask me another time about being a Solution Architect or Chef, as a few folks here know, I can drone on for hours.
* Prior to working at Progress, I was a Sr. Manager at Optum which held the corporate IT platforms for all of UnitedHealth Group which included Optum and United Healthcare. I was there for 21 years, and the last ten I spend in a leadership position and have interviewed and hired my fair share of people across the globe.
* The last 6 years, I ran a team called DevOps Enablement Services where we primarily managed the Chef platform and Community of Practice. I had the fortune of building that team from scratch and brought folks will all sorts of backgrounds together to deliver a tools with a DevOps experience.

* So, I've said DevOps a lot there. And this is an Orlando DevOps Community Group Meetup.
* How many people think they have an understand of or can define DevOps?
* Who is new to this terminology?
* Ok, so here is my definition of DevOps.
* I like to define it as a set of practices and principles that allow businesses to accelerate the delivery of products and services. There are a lot of things that DevOps is NOT.
* It is NOT a job, although that is in contrary to the topic.
* It is NOT a team, although I will often mention it that way.
* It is NOT a CI/CD pipeline, although many believe it to be.
* And it is NOT a Product, although Microsoft and others like to sell it that way.
* Well, actually it is a little bit all of those things and the term gets co-opted in that and more.
* To me, deep down, it's about Operational Tasks, moving them to a Development process and Mindset.
* If you are a Developer, it is about including the Operations Tasks and thinking operationally about the things you deliver.
* Roles such as Cloud or Platform Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, and even Software Engineers and IT Operations all play a part in DevOps.

* I am also one of the organizers for our Orlando DevOps Community Group. Before we get started, I want to thank Mike Buchoff, Dan Crenshaw, Milan Landaverde, Jacob Hiers, and the newest member of our team who you got to meet first, Paulo De Souza.
* With that, I am stoked to be able to sit down with our guests today and get their perspectives on "Preparing for your next DevOps Role".

* Up First, I would like to welcome Esteban Garcia to the stage!

Welcome Esteban. Little be known, Esteban ran the Orlando DevOps Meetup Group when I first met him. I am incredibly thankful for getting this started for us all.

Esteban, want to introduce yourself?

* Tell me a little bit about your journey. How did you get to lead Xebia's US Microsoft Practice.
* When bringing in consultants to help your practice, what do you look for?
* You have been involved in starting or enhancing many of the Tech communities here including the .net group and our own Orlando DevOps Meetup, tell me why that was important to you.
* Do you look for community on candidates resumes?
* Do you encourage your team to participate in community events?
* What would you suggest to students currently studying CS? What should they do above classwork?

Thank you very much! Let's all give Esteban a hand for taking the time and willing to be first. He does a lot of speaking engagements, so I am sure it was no sweat.
