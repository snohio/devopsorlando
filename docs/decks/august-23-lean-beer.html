## [Code of Conduct](https://orlandodevs.com/code-of-conduct/)

> This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Orlando Devs community (relevant to both our Slack and Meetup), as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

### Our open source community strives to:

* Be friendly and patient.
* Be welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. 
* Be considerate: Your actions (and words) affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember that we’re a very diverse community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.
* Be respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* Be careful in the words that we choose: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.
* Try to understand why we disagree: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

# Open Space Format

> Open Space is a process that allows everyone to participate in sessions with others whom they may not normally have a chance to talk with. 

> Like Agile itself, Open Space Technology sessions operate under a small set of guiding principles. These principles are deceptively simple, yet provide just enough structure for spontaneous discussions:

### Guidelines

* Whoever comes are the right people.
* Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.
* Whenever it starts is the right time.
* Whenever it’s over, it’s over.
* Wherever it happens is the right place.
