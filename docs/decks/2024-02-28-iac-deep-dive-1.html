## [Code of Conduct](https://orlandodevs.com/code-of-conduct/)

> This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Orlando Devs community (relevant to both our Slack and Meetup), as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

### Our open source community strives to:

#### Be friendly and patient.
#### Be welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. 
#### Be considerate: Your actions (and words) affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember that we’re a very diverse community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.
#### Be respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
#### Be careful in the words that we choose: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.
#### Try to understand why we disagree: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

* Progress Chef is made up of a few different DevOps tools.
* Chef Infra is our Traditional Infrastructure as Code / Configuration as Code product.
* Chef Inspec is Compliance as Code - taking your System Compute Policies and Standards (CIS / STIG benchmarks) and Codifying them in human readable (Auditor understandable) code.
* I do want to mention that Chef as a Commercial Product is Open Source Software. There is a community build of both Infra and Inspec from that same source code called CINC.
* Other Chef products - Desktop, which is an extension of Chef Infra and Inspec, Habitat is focused on Application Delivery (think container like application delivery) and Courier as Job Orchestration (Coming soon!)
