We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

### Our community strives to:

#### **Be friendly and patient.**
#### **Be welcoming** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. 
#### **Be considerate** Your actions (and words) affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember that we’re a very diverse community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.
#### **Be respectful** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
#### **Be careful in the words that we choose** we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.
#### **Try to understand why we disagree** Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

## Mike Butler - Progress Chef
<img src="../assets/mike-butler-speaker.jpg" align="left" width="300" hspace="50">
<br>
### DevOps Enthusiast, Space Nerd, and Senior Sales Engineer
<br><br><br>
#### DevOps Enthusiast since 2016, space nerd and currently Sr. Sales Engineer at Progress for Chef Software. Mike has seen all sides of the Coded Enterprise, being the product owner for Chef at a very large healthcare organization. It is always a challenge to help application and OS support teams to understand “shifting left” or better local development, local testing, using a source code repository for code and helping to identify and track work. Treating Everything as Code helps drive DevOps for n00bs, it certainly helped him!
???
NOTES: (5 minutes)

* Thanks Dan! So before we jump in and to give folks a bit of a taste for what's to come this evening, I have a couple of questions for you.
* Tell me a little bit about the Computer Science program here at Rollins.
* What are some of the changes Rollins has made to modernize it's programs with the introduction of DevOps and Cloud & Platform Engineering?
* What do you see coming with the latest advances in AI? How is that changing the programs here at Rollins?

MY BIO (5 minutes)

* So, Hi there! My name is Mike Butler. I am a Solution Architect at Progress Chef. Ask me another time about being a Solution Architect or Chef, as a few folks here know, I can drone on for hours.
* Prior to working at Progress, I was a Sr. Manager at Optum which held the corporate IT platforms for all of UnitedHealth Group which included Optum and United Healthcare. I was there for 21 years, and the last ten I spend in a leadership position and have interviewed and hired my fair share of people across the globe.
* The last 6 years, I ran a team called DevOps Enablement Services where we primarily managed the Chef platform and Community of Practice. I had the fortune of building that team from scratch and brought folks will all sorts of backgrounds together to deliver a tools with a DevOps experience.

* So, I've said DevOps a lot there. And this is an Orlando DevOps Community Group Meetup.
* How many people think they have an understand of or can define DevOps? 
* Who is new to this terminology?
* Ok, so here is my definition of DevOps.
* I like to define it as a set of practices and principles that allow businesses to accelerate the delivery of products and services. There are a lot of things that DevOps is NOT. 
* It is NOT a job, although that is in contrary to the topic. 
* It is NOT a team, although I will often mention it that way.
* It is NOT a CI/CD pipeline, although many believe it to be.
* And it is NOT a Product, although Microsoft and others like to sell it that way.
* Well, actually it is a little bit all of those things and the term gets co-opted in that and more.
* To me, deep down, it's about Operational Tasks, moving them to a Development process and Mindset. 
* If you are a Developer, it is about including the Operations Tasks and thinking operationally about the things you deliver.
* Roles such as Cloud or Platform Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, and even Software Engineers and IT Operations all play a part in DevOps. 

* I am also one of the organizers for our Orlando DevOps Community Group. Before we get started, I want to thank Mike Buchoff, Dan Crenshaw, Milan Landaverde, Jacob Hiers, and the newest member of our team who you got to meet first, Paulo De Souza.
* With that, I am stoked to be able to sit down with our guests today and get their perspectives on "Preparing for your next DevOps Role".

* Up First, I would like to welcome Esteban Garcia to the stage!

???
NOTES: The Path from Student to Successful DevOps / Platform Engineer

Next we have Milan Landavere, who as I mentioned earlier is one of our co-organizers.

This meeting idea came from a Lean Beer event we were having and someone asked about what certifications to look at getting. Milan then said something that gave me chills. We'll get to that in a moment, but Milan, go ahead and introduce yourself.

* Tell me about your Journey
* Taking time - What you did when in between position.
* Why did you focus on Open Source Contribution rather than certifications?
* How did that help you get your NVIDIA job?
* What is the difference between working at a startup vs larger companies?
* Getting involved in community
* *What technologies are you using and feel are important in the DevOps landscape*

Thanks Milan! That was a great sit down and I wish we had a lot more time.

Greg Brown, come on down! You are the next contestant!

## Greg Brown - TekSystems

<br>
### Technology Operations & Infrastructure Services Recruiter
<br><br><br><br>
#### Greg Brown is a national Cloud/DevOps recruiter with TEKsystems based in Orlando. After a two-decade career in hospitality, a pause due to COVID prompted him to reevaluate his work-life balance. Witnessing the fulfillment his sister-in-law and wife found at TEKsystems, Greg made the transition, now in his fourth year with the company. He revels in the opportunity to impact lives daily, leveraging his specialization in the ever-evolving Cloud/DevOps realm. Greg thrives in building relationships across the US, Canada, and India, constantly learning and embracing the dynamic nature of both technology and recruitment.
???
NOTES: Working with candidates, what your customers are looking for and really what is Talent Sourcing.

I just recently met Greg through Nick Quintero who is an Account Manager for Tek Systems. Greg is a Technology Operations & Infrastructure Services Recruiter recruiter for TekSystems.

I have a real soft spot for TekSystems because way back when, they helped me find a position that really catapulted my career. They were amazing to work with back then and I've had conversations from TekSystems over the years, and it is always positive and friendly.

* Tell me a little bit about your journey.
* What is Talent Sourcing?
* How does someone successfully engage with a recruiter?
* What are the most important things on a persons resume?
* What is the market like right now?

Put it together for Greg. Greg, was this the first time being on a stage like this? You did awesome! 

Finally, I'd like to introduce someone whom I met when working for Progress. Funny story is that I had been there for about 2 months and I was told we hired a DevOps Centric VP of Software. I was super excited about that and when I started to learn more, it turned out he was not only here in Orlando, but lives about 5 miles!

???
NOTES: Digging in to DevOps and all of the Arts of Engineering

Welcome Aaron!! So, I mentioned working at Progress but tell me what you are up to now.

* Your background has been more around Software Engineering, tell me a little about your journey and when you discovered DevOps.
* Being a leader yourself, how do we keep DevOps or at least the founding principles in front of and an importance to Executive Leadership?
* Like Milan, you've worked at companies of all sizes most recently as the CTO of a start-up, what is that like?
* We were talking the other day and discussing the DevOps movement in general, what have we gotten right? What is next?
* What advice would you give people that are looking for that next level roll, moving into a leadership position?
* In working with you at Progress Chef, I know that an Agile Transformation is important. How does that tie to DevOps and what should those just starting out know?

Thank you, thank you!! Honestly, I can sit down over beer with Aaron and talk all day. I'm glad we still get to do just that a few times a year.
