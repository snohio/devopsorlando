## [Code of Conduct](https://orlandodevs.com/code-of-conduct/)

> This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Orlando Devs community (relevant to both our Slack and Meetup), as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

### Our open source community strives to:

* Be friendly and patient.
* Be welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. 
* Be considerate: Your actions (and words) affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember that we’re a very diverse community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.
* Be respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
* Be careful in the words that we choose: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.
* Try to understand why we disagree: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

# Lean DevOps (Coffee) Format

> Lean DevOps (Lean Coffee) is a process that allows everyone to participate in discussion with others whom they may not normally have a chance to talk with. 

> Like Agile itself, Lean Coffee sessions operate under a small set of steps. These steps are deceptively simple, yet provide just enough structure for spontaneous discussions:

### Steps

1. Write topics on a PostIt (these will be put into a Google Survey)
2. 30 Seconds to present your topic.
3. Vote on the Topics on the Survey (QR Code)
4. Topics are ordered to most votes to least. These are put on a Kanban Board.
5. We talk about the topics one at a time. Each topic you get 5 minutes to discuss.
6. After 5 minutes, more time (3 min) can be added with a majority vote.
7. When it is done, move that to Done and grab the next To Do
