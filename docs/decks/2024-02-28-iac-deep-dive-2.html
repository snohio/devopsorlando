## [Code of Conduct](https://orlandodevs.com/code-of-conduct/)

> This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the Orlando Devs community (relevant to both our Slack and Meetup), as well as steps to reporting unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inspiring community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

### Our open source community strives to:

#### Be friendly and patient.
#### Be welcoming: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. 
#### Be considerate: Your actions (and words) affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account. Remember that we’re a very diverse community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.
#### Be respectful: Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.
#### Be careful in the words that we choose: we are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.
#### Try to understand why we disagree: Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

### If you have not done this already, take a picture of this slide with your phone, tune out the remainder of this presentation and begin working on this:
- Head to https://azure.microsoft.com/ and create a free account.

- Install the **Azure CLI** - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
  - Windows: `winget install -e --id Microsoft.AzureCLI`
  - Mac: `brew update && brew install azure-cli`

- Link your Azure CLI with your private Azure environment. You can confirm this by typing `az account show`. If it says you need to log in, run `az login` and try again. On success, you should see something similar to what I was shown:
  ```
  {
    "environmentName": "AzureCloud",
    "homeTenantId": "7e76db18-1eed-4eb7-a1eb-f55795485f9a",
    "id": "23119635-4668-4bee-a613-24fdd1634eee",
    ...

##Why do we need IAC, an example
<br>
###Your company is about to create an exciting ToDo List app.
---

class: foo
##Why do we need IAC, an example
<br>
###While writing the code, you need somewhere to deploy.
<br>
###You use the Portal to create your webapp, sql server/db, and app insights.
---

class: foo
##Why do we need IAC, an example
<br>
###Although your ToDo List runs correctly from your desktop, this is not the case in the cloud.
<br>
###After spending a full day and frantically tweaking a bunch of settings, your services finally talk to each other.

---

class: foo
##Why do we need IAC, an example
<br>
###It is time to for QA to test.
<br>
###You attempt to use the portal to create the a similar set of resources for a test environment.

---

class: foo
##Why do we need IAC, an example
<br>
###What could go wrong?
- ###The names don't exactly line up
- ###It's anyone's guess as to whether you adjusted the same settings.
- ###You may have exterraneous resources in one of the environments
---

class: foo
##Why do we need IAC, an example
<br>
###Although your code worked great, you spend a lot of time tweaking your cloud settings to get the test environment to match dev. Nonetheless, it finally works!
---

class: foo
##Why do we need IAC, an example
<br>
###It's time to deploy to production. Guess where this is going.
---

class: foo
##Why do we need IAC, an example
<br>
###All three environments are slightly misaligned and probably behave differently.
<br>
###Perhaps one has sticky sessions, while the other has more relaxed security.
---

class: foo
##Why do we need IAC, an example
<br>
###It gets worse.
<br>
###People love your ToDo app, but want more checkboxes. You decide to add a redis cache and blob storage to track which boxes are checked.
---

class: foo
##Why do we need IAC, an example
<br>
###It is likely your next deployment to prod will cause issues:
  - You may forget to create necessary resources and have to debug issues during downtime in prod
  - Your resources may not be set up correctly, causing communication issues between them
  - Introducing security is risky because it may work in lower environments, but not in prod due to the misaligned settings
  - You may experience other behavior differences in prod (ie unintended logging verbosity, storage retention differences, etc)

---

class: foo
##Why do we need IAC, an example
###If you have multiple dev/test/prod environments (geographical regions, for example), the problem grows exponentially
  - You have to test different environments more thoroughly to gain confidence in them
  - The testing in the test environment may succeed when the same steps in prod do not
  - You may have issues in one prod environment that isn't in others
  - You need to repeat monotonous steps once per prod environment, potential for human error

###If you add new environments, you have additional problems.

###Difference between IaC tools
- ###Provisioning
  - Terraform/OpenTofu (declarative), has state-management
  - Pulomi (imperative)
  - CloudFormations (declarative)
  - vRealize Automation (vRA, declarative) and vRealize Orchestrator (vRO, imperative)
- ###Configuration Management
  - Ansible (declarative, push)
  - Puppet (declarative, pull)
  - Chef (declarative, but allows imperiative for custom steps, pull)

#What are we doing today?
- Clone [my repo](https://github.com/mbuchoff/devops-vanilla-example)
- [Download/install OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/docs/intro/install/) (or Teraform, all good)
- Run Tofu
  ```
  cd tofu
  tofu init
  tofu apply
  ```
- Confirm in Azure Portal that your resources were actually created.
- Extra credit (out of scope today):
  - Generate scaffolding sql script: `./2-efcore.ps1`
  - Run the scaffolding script: `./3-apply-migration-script.ps1`
  - Fork my repo and set up GitHub actions.
