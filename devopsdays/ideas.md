# DevOpsDays Orlando

## Goals

* 150 - 200 would be a legitimate goal. I think we size to that.
* Cost at no more than $159 (early bird 60+ days before) $199 (30 days before) $249 (full price)
* I think $100k is probably a reasonable budget. That is made of the following
  * 150 people at $200
  * 2 Founding at $15000
  * 1 Platinum at $10000
  * 5 Gold at $5000
  * 5 Silver at $3000

## Locations

Couple of options on the list here at this point.

* [The Wave](https://www.lakenonawavehotel.com/orlando-event-venues/lake-nona-event-venues) in Lake Nona
* [Winter Park Events Center](https://cityofwinterpark.org/departments/parks-recreation/library-events-center/reservations/) in Winter Park
  * Next to the Library. Parking could be an issue.
  * Could be good for after hour space outside with a band and beverages
  * Open Spaces might have to be spread to outside (weather depending) but that could be good to.
* [Guidewell](https://guidewellinnovation.com/our-space/) in Lake Nona
  * This is an operating co-op so midweek during the day could be tricky.
  * Looks like it would max at 200 people
  * Main presentation area is "in the round" meaning speakers would be comfortable presenting in 360 degrees.
* [Vanguard](https://www.thevanguard.live/venue)
  * So, yeah, this is an electronic music club.
  * It is Downtown!
  * It has a large space to hold up to 2000
  * Would need to check the cleanliness and make sure they have seating.
  * There seems to be a lot of space in and around the main presentation area.
  * Could be a high energy event.
  * Not sure they they have Open Space area.
  * They have food and beverage service.
* [Marriott Orlando Downtown](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/mcodo-marriott-orlando-downtown/events/)
  * I'm not too serious about this space because I don't really want to do it in a "normal" hotel convention space (the Wave is different)
  * We should get pricing to have comparisons.
  * It will have all we need.

## Date Options

These are general dates. The can slide forward or backward. I would prefer to avoid Friday for sure. Monday might be good if we get travel and families want to do Sat / Sun at parks.

1. March 4-5 (Mo-Tu)
2. March 6-7 (We-Th)
3. Feb 27-28 (Tu-We)
4. Apr 2-3 (Tu-We)

UCF and OC / SC schools on break March 6 - 22

## Non-Profit

* Work with ODevs as our Non-profit Organization
  * Will need to work with them and make sure all Orlando DevOps Community group funding gets a GL code.

## Things to Check

* Orlando has funds for tech conferences.
* Will we need insurance?  
   >Commercial General Liability (Occurrence Form) patterned after the current ISO form
   >
   >$1,000,000.00 single limit per occurrence
   >
   >$2,000,000.00 aggregate for Bodily Injury Liability & Property Damage Liability.
   >
   >This shall include Premises and Operations; Independent Contractors Products & Completed Operations & Contractual Liability.

Need an idea of venue costs and how many spaces for true costing

  * $5,000 of which will go into funding for future years (if possible)
  * 3 years of acknowledgement
  * 3 minute product talk (not with others)
  * Logo on Website, Top of Schedule

* Platinum - $10,000 (2)
