## DevOpsDays Location Ideas for 50 - 250

* [Lake Nona Wave Hotel](https://www.lakenonawavehotel.com/orlando-event-venues/lake-nona-event-venues)
  * In the heart of Lake Nona.
  * Should hold 250 for the whole venue.
  * There is not a lot of exhibitor space.
* [Winter Park Event Center](https://cityofwinterpark.org/departments/parks-recreation/library-events-center/)
  * Would require use of outside for open spaces
  * Should hold 250
  * Awesome place to do an outdoor concert for the cocktail reception
  * Best [Floor Plan](https://www.architecturalrecord.com/ext/resources/Issues/2022/03-March/Winter-Park-Library-and-Events-Center-10.jpg) that I could find
* [The Wellview](https://thewellvue.com/)
  * Seats about 160 - 180 people in the main hall.
  * The big issue with this venue is that we cannot use it during the week DAYS.
* [GuideWell Innovation](https://guidewellinnovation.com/book-an-event/)
  * Interesting space with Main Presentation space in the round.
  * Looks like about 150 - 200 people max in the main space.
* Seminole State
* UCF
* Full Sail
